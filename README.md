Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

This is the composite collection of problems from the book Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: With Application to Understanding Data Second Edition. by John Guttag. The problem sets are avoided intentionally because they are not good for learning Python efficiently and I found them very confusing. The book is good and informative.
